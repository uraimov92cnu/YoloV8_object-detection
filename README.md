Iris and pupil detection

Predicting iris and pupil from RGB eye images is an important task in many applications such as biometric identification, medical diagnosis, and computer vision. The iris and pupil are important features of the eye and contain useful information about the individual's identity, health status, and gaze direction.

The YoloV8 model is a state-of-the-art object detection model that can be used to detect and localize objects in images and videos. The YoloV8 model is fast, accurate, and can be trained on large datasets with high efficiency. By using the YoloV8 model for iris and pupil detection, we can achieve high accuracy and speed in real-time applications.

One advantage of using the YoloV8 model for iris and pupil detection is that it can detect and localize multiple objects in a single image or frame, which is useful in scenarios where there are multiple people or objects in the image. Moreover, the YoloV8 model can be fine-tuned on specific datasets and tasks, which allows us to improve the accuracy and adapt the model to specific application requirements.

In summary, predicting iris and pupil from RGB eye images using the YoloV8 model is an important and challenging task that has many practical applications in biometrics, medicine, and computer vision. The YoloV8 model provides a powerful tool for accurate and efficient object detection and localization, which can be leveraged for iris and pupil detection in real-world scenarios.
